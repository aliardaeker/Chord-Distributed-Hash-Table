03.08.18

Frameworks:
- hashlib -> to compute the SHA-256 hash of keys
- socket  -> to find the ip address of the machine that server.py runs on. This is used to compte NodeID 
- logging -> for thrift error messages

Python is used

How to run:
1 - set the PATH to /home/yaoliu/src_code/local/bin
2 - thrift -gen py chord.thrift
3 - run the server with server.py <port number>
4 - run init with node.txt
5 - run the client to test
